## SEE https://github.com/allisonhorst/esm206-f2020-labs/tree/main/lab_2

## Lab 2 objectives:

- Project management (more subfolder structure & `here`)
- Continue meeting R Markdown
- More data wrangling (filtering, `mutate()`, and summary tables with `group_by` + `summarize`)
- Customization in `ggplot2`

## Packages required: 

- `tidyverse`
- `janitor`
- `here`
- `palmerpenguins`

### 1. Lab set-up & project management: 

- Create a new R Project (within your ESM 206 labs folder)
- Add subfolders `data`, `img`, `src`
- Copy and paste the `ca_ag_2014.csv` file into the project `data` folder
- In RStudio, create a new RMarkdown doc (.Rmd). Save to the `src` folder
- In your new R Markdown document, attach the `tidyverse`, `janitor`, `here`, and `palmerpenguins` packages in the setup chunk

## 2. A couple more R Markdown tips 

1. URL

    - Add a functional URL by just copying & pasting it: https://www.ucsb.edu/

    - Or add linked text [like this](https://www.ucsb.edu/).

2. Superscripts / subscripts

    - Superscript text with a ^ on either side: like^this^

    - Subscript text with a ~ on either side: like~this~

3. Add image from a URL

    - Find an image online (for more octocats - the GitHub mascot- visit https://octodex.github.com/)

    - Right click > Copy image location

    - Paste the image location into the parentheses in this format: `![](paste_image_location_here.png)`

For example: 

![](https://octodex.github.com/images/dinotocat.png)

But ask yourself: how does that break? What might be a safer and more robust way to include an image? 

## 3. Read in the data 

Today we'll use information from California crop production from 2014. 

First, open the CSV in Excel or other spreadsheet software (outside of R, open the file & it will open in Excel if you have it). Make sure to take a look at the data after you read them in. **Note:** Your file path will differ from the one below.

```{r}
# Read in the ca_agriculture.csv file
ca_ag <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_ag_2014.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
# Include clean_names() when I read in the data, as a general practice

```

## 4. More `dplyr::filter()` examples

### In-Class examples of dplyer:filter()
```{r}
ex_1 <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(county == "Fresno") #only return rows that county variable contains "fresno"
  
```

## Use unique function to return all unique levels of any column
```{r}
unique(ex_1$county) # this function exists in base R package; shows all unique values within a column ("$" refers to a column)
```

## a. Keep data from counties "Kern" OR "Inyo" OR "Mono"

Use `%in%` to look for multiple acceptable matches. 

### long way 

```{r}
ex_2 <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(county == "Fresno" | county == "Madera" | county == "Kern") # essentially pipe symbols are OR booleans (i.e., filter county for "Fresno" OR "Madera" OR "Kern")

# check unique values to ensure that filtering worked above (should return only the three counties above)
unique(ex_2$county)
```

## The "%in%" operator allows you to write an "OR" statement with multiple conditions that act on the same variable. Essentially, in the case it asks "does the value of this column match any of the values in this vector?"

### keep any observations (rows) that contain the value of the county column (variable) exists in this vector of values that I give you next. Lower case "c" creates a vector

```{r}
ex_a <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(county %in% c("Kern", "Madera", "Fresno"))
```

**You almost never want to use filter() and a sequence of values in a vector becuase it will look for those values in that order within the dataframe. This could lead to problems because it goes row by row and checks for those outcomes in order and so it depends on the order of the values in the dataframe and therefore may take away things I don't want it to. If you use the %in% operator, it will check  every row and asks in the species column does it match cat or dog? then goes to the second row and does the same thing and continues in this way which is much better since it doesn't depend on order**

## example 4
```{r}
ex_4 <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(county == "Inyo" | crop_name == "WOOL") #this will filter for rows that contain "inyo" in county or "wool" in crop name
```

## AND statements in filter (all of these work, but Prof Horst uses comma): 
1. Write different filter lines 
2. Seperate "and" statements with a comma within filter 
3. Seperate "and" statements with an ampersand ("&") within filter


### Create a subset of the ca_ag data where crop name is WOOL *and* the production is greater than 50,000
```{r}
ex_5 <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(crop_name == "WOOL") %>% # now check first and statement to make sure it worked before adding the others
  filter(production > 50000) # this gives and statement 

```

#### Could also write this as follows: 
```{r}
ex_5 <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(crop_name == "WOOL" & production > 50000)
```

#### Or you could also write it with a comma, as follows: 
```{r}
ex_5 <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(crop_name == "WOOL", production > 50000)
```


b. Keep data for all counties EXCEPT Merced

Use `!=` to say "DOES NOT MATCH":

```{r}
ex_b <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(county != "Merced")
```

**Tip:** Use the `unique()` function to check with distinct groups remain in a variable

c. Keep observations where crop is "GOATS MILK" and county is "Humboldt"

```{r}
ex_c <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(crop_name == "GOATS MILK", county == "Humboldt")
```

d. Keep observations where crop is "GRAPES WINE" **or** harvest acres is greater than 1,000,000:

```{r}
ex_d <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(crop_name == "GRAPES WINE" | harvest_acres > 1e6)
```

## 5. `mutate()` to add a new column (or transform an existing one)

We'll use the `mutate()` function in dplyr (part of the tidyverse) to add a new column, or to transform an existing one. 

In `ca_ag`, we have a column for "production" and one for "price per unit". We want a new column containing the value for each observation:

```{r}
ca_ag_value <- ca_ag %>% 
  mutate(value_usd = production * price_per_unit)
```

We can also use `mutate()` to transform existing columns. 

```{r}
ca_ag_lower <- ca_ag %>% 
  mutate(crop_name = str_to_lower(crop_name))
```


## 6. `group_by()` + `summarize()` for tables of summary statistics

We often want to find summary statistics (e.g. mean, standard deviation, max, min, etc.) within *groups* for our data. For example, we may want to find the total *value* of crops by *county* for California in 2014. But it would be really tedious to make a different subset for each county, then find those statistics. 

Instead, we will use the powerful combination of `dplyr::group_by()` and `summarize()` to:

- Recognize distinct groups within a variable
- Apply a function to each *group*
- Return the outcomes in a nice table

It is awesome. You should plan on using this all the time (if you're an Excel wizard, this is your replacement for pivot tables).

Here's a little example first using the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). View the `penguins` data (`View(penguins)`). 

```{r}
penguin_bill_lengths <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_bill_length_mm = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

penguin_size_summary <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_flipper_length_mm = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),
            sample_size = n())

penguin_size_summary
```

Now let's try one for our CA ag data, as part of a piped sequence! 

a. Create a summary table of the total sum of *value* by *county* for "GRAPES WINE". 

```{r}
ca_grapes <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(crop_name == "GRAPES WINE", county != "State Total") %>% 
  mutate(value = production * price_per_unit) %>% 
  group_by(county) %>% 
  summarize(
    total_value_usd = sum(value)
  ) %>% 
  slice_max(total_value_usd, n = 10)

ca_grapes # return the table in knitted doc
```

## 7. Customizing ggplot graphs

```{r}
cc_ag <- ca_ag %>% 
  filter(county %in% c("San Luis Obispo", "Santa Barbara", "Ventura"))
ggplot(data = cc_ag, aes(x = county, y = production)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, 
              alpha = 0.8,
              size = 2,
              aes(color = county),
              show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("purple",
                                "darkorange",
                                "cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "California county",
       y = "Agricultural production (acres per farm)", 
       title = "California agriculture (2014)")
```
